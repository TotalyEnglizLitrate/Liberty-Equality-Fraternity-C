## But, what are functions
^14c3c5

A function in programming is more or less the same as a function in math. take the inverse sin function, $sin^{-1}(x)$ . You give it some arbitrary input $x$, and it spits out some value $y$ for which $y = sin(x)$, you also have to make sure your input value $x$ abides by some constraints. i.e $x \in [-1, 1]$ and you know that $y$ will be some angle, either in radians or in degrees, it may or may not be the principal value, etc. Also, if say, $x \notin [-1,1] \implies sin^{-1}(x)$ does not have a real answer. i.e this is an invalid input and as such you do not get output.

So, a function in programming is one that takes in some **defined input**, and (\*sometimes, we'll get to that) gives you some **defined output and/or error**(\*also not strictly true, but again, we'll get to that.)
