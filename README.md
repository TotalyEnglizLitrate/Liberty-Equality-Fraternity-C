# Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, C

This is currently a work in progress, this is meant to serve as a guide to C built on top of the [Programming in C course syllabus](https://github.com/TotalyEnglizLitrate/Liberty--Equality--Fraternity--C/blob/master/syllabus.pdf) at Shiv Nadar University Chennai, that goes a little bit beyond the syllabus in some places.
